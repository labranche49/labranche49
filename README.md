- 👋 Hi, I’m @labranche49
- 👀 I’m interested in new technology, as an old programmer with old methodologies, and old technical ways...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how we can implement new applications with actual possibilities (web, graphics conception, documentation, online testing, etc...)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to expend the software knowledge to people that use computers and never have participate to build a project ...
- 📫 How to reach me : leave a message in my repository, later by mail or phone...
- 😄 Pronouns: I am French, I understand some spanish, I speak english - not fluentely 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am retired, older than you but curious !
- I will ask for a GitHub Copilot later on, when I will be better in coding
